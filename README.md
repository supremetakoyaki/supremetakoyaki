### Hey there üç£
This is my GitHub profile, where I will showcase my hobby projects and future university assignments too.
I can speak English, Spanish, and understand French and Japanese to an extent.

I go by the name **T**. Because "T" is a one-letter name, I use words or other names beginning with T as usernames.

### About my hobby projects üß∂
My strongest language is C#, and a lot of my projects will be in that language. That means it'll be mostly Windows-only, sadly.
I am also pretty familiar with Python, C and Java.
I am mostly into video game reverse engineering, ROM hacking, save editing and other related stuff! 

My most successful project right now: [The TWEWY Final Remix & NEO:TWEWY save editor, titled ***Scramble***](https://github.com/supremetakoyaki/Scramble)
