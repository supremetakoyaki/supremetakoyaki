### Hey there 🍣
I'm T, a computer engineering student living in Chile. I'm very busy with uni right now . . .
You're free to check out some of the projects I've worked on!

### Hobby projects 🧶
I made two save editors, and I still plan on working on them.
- [Scramble](https://github.com/supremetakoyaki/Scramble), a (pretty much complete) Neo: The World Ends with You and The World Ends with You -Final Remix- save editor.
- [Aogami](https://github.com/supremetakoyaki/Aogami), a Shin Megami Tensei V save editor.
