### Hey there 🍣
I'm T.
I can speak English, Spanish, and understand French and Japanese to an extent.

### About my hobby projects 🧶
Some projects I've been working on lately:
- [Scramble](https://github.com/supremetakoyaki/Scramble), a Neo: The World Ends with You and The World Ends with You -Final Remix- save editor.
- [Aogami](https://github.com/supremetakoyaki/Aogami), a Shin Megami Tensei V save editor.

(They're not abandoned!! I'm just too busy with uni. Please forgive me.)
